That's a project from Matrix Master Bootcamp #14

These were the instructions: 

What you have to do:
 I can start a 25-minute, and the timer will go off once 25 minutes have elapsed.
 I can reset the clock for my next.
 I can customize the length of each time.
 I can get a sound notification when the time is finished.

How it works:

Just set the time for your alarm, you can reset it if you want.
